## Introduction/Overview
This document describes the requirements for building a clone of the Top Gear SNES game using Pygame. The goal is to create a full-featured 2D racing game that simulates depth and perspective by dynamically scaling and drawing rows of road sprites, closely resembling the original SNES experience.

## Goals
- Deliver a playable, complete racing game experience for retro gamers.
- Accurately simulate road perspective and movement using dynamic scaling of sprites.
- Achieve smooth gameplay at 60 FPS using Pygame.
- Replicate the look and feel of the SNES Top Gear game.

## User Stories
- As a retro gamer, I want to accelerate, brake, and steer my car so that I can race against the clock and complete laps.
- As a player, I want to see my speed, timer, lap count, and fuel on the HUD so that I can track my progress and manage my race.
- As a player, I want to pause the game so that I can take breaks without losing progress.
- As a player, I want the road and scenery to look and move like the original SNES game so that I feel nostalgic.

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow the player to accelerate, brake, and steer the car using keyboard input.
2. The system must render the road using dynamically scaled sprites to simulate perspective.
3. The system must display a background layer with distant scenery (sky, mountains).
4. The system must place road strips and roadside objects (trees, signposts) as sprites on a second layer.
5. The system must show static HUD elements (speedometer, timer, lap count, fuel) on a separate layer.
6. The system must allow the player to pause and resume the game.
7. The system must track and display lap completion and race progress.
8. The system must run smoothly at 60 FPS.
9. The system must use Pygame for all rendering and input handling.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Multiplayer functionality is not included.
- Car upgrades, customization, or selection are not included.
- Online features or leaderboards are not included.

## Design Considerations
- The visual style should closely match the SNES Top Gear game, including sprite design, color palette, and HUD layout.
- Layering should be used to separate background, road, objects, and HUD for clarity and maintainability.

## Technical Considerations
- Must use Pygame for graphics, input, and game loop.
- Target frame rate is 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.
- Code should be organized for readability and maintainability, with small functions (max 10 lines each).

## Success Metrics
- The game runs at a stable 60 FPS on typical hardware.
- The road perspective effect is visually convincing and matches the SNES style.
- Players can complete laps, see HUD data, and pause/resume the game.
- No major bugs or crashes during normal gameplay.

## Open Questions
- Should there be AI opponents or is it strictly a time trial?
- How many tracks or environments should be included?
- What sound/music assets will be used, and are there licensing concerns?
