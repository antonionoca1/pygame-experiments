## Relevant Files

- `src/main.py` - Main game loop and initialization.
- `src/hud.py` - Handles HUD rendering (speedometer, timer, lap count, fuel).
- `src/platform_manager.py` - Manages road strips and perspective scaling.
- `src/player.py` - Player car logic and controls.
- `src/events.py` - Input handling (keyboard events).
- `assets/` - Sprites and images for road, scenery, objects, and HUD.
- `test/` - Directory for unit and integration tests.

### Notes
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `test/test_hud.py` for `hud.py`).
- Use `python -m unittest discover` or similar to run all tests.
